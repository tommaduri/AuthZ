# CretoAI - Executive Summary

**Quantum-Resistant Security for the Agentic Enterprise**

---

## The Problem: Quantum Threats to AI Autonomy

**Enterprises are deploying millions of autonomous AI agents**, managing critical operations from financial transactions to healthcare decisions. But these agents face two existential threats:

### 1. **The Quantum Computing Threat** (2030-2035 Timeline)
- **NSA CNSA 2.0 Mandate**: All federal systems must migrate to quantum-resistant cryptography by 2035
- **NERC CIP-015-1**: Critical infrastructure (power grids) must adopt post-quantum crypto by September 2025
- **"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later"**: Adversaries are storing encrypted data today to decrypt with future quantum computers

**Current Reality**:
- RSA-2048 will be broken by quantum computers with ~4,000 qubits
- Google's Willow chip (Dec 2024) demonstrates quantum supremacy
- Timeline to practical attacks: **5-10 years, not decades**

### 2. **AI Agent Authorization at Scale**
- Traditional identity systems designed for humans, not millions of AI agents
- No enterprise-grade authorization for Non-Human Identities (NHI)
- Lack of immutable audit trails for autonomous decisions
- Byzantine threats: malicious agents in distributed systems

---

## The Solution: CretoAI Platform

**CretoAI provides the only production-ready quantum-resistant security platform** designed specifically for enterprise agentic AI systems.

### Core Value Proposition

```
Classical Security          CretoAI Security
─────────────────          ─────────────────
RSA/ECDSA                  → ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA (NIST FIPS 203/204)
Human-centric identity     → Non-Human Identity (NHI) at scale
Centralized trust          → Byzantine fault tolerance
Mutable logs               → Immutable DAG audit trails
Quantum-vulnerable         → Quantum-safe until 2050+
```

### Technical Differentiation

**We are the ONLY platform that combines**:
1. **NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography** (ML-KEM, ML-DSA)
2. **Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus** (Avalanche protocol)
3. **Enterprise-scale performance** (56,271 TPS, 177ms finality)
4. **Production-ready deployment** (Docker, Kubernetes, multi-cloud)
