# Week 1 Business Development Strategy - Creto Systems

**Date:** November 27, 2025
**Focus:** Strategic customer acquisition and partnership activation
**Timeline:** Week 1 (immediate execution)

---

## Strategic Context

**Current State:**
- Creto AI: 70-80% complete (quantum-resistant platform)
- Authorization by Creto: Rust rewrite in progress (3 active swarms)
- Sovereign Vault: Rust rewrite in progress
- Documentation: Accurate positioning complete (audit-verified)

**Market Position:**
- ✅ **Unique**: Only authorization vendor with quantum-resistant roadmap (12-18 month competitive moat)

**Opportunity Details:**

**NextEra Energy ($170B market cap, Critical Infrastructure)**
- **Need**: NERC CIP-015-1 quantum compliance (September 2025 deadline)
- **Pain**: Power grid authorization = national security risk
- **Fit**: Authorization by Creto + quantum-resistant roadmap = regulatory compliance
- **Decision maker**: CISO / VP of Security

### Priority 2: KPMG Partnership Activation 🔥
**Strategic Score: 9.0/10 (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Why Priority 2:**
- ✅ **Existing partnership** (faster activation than cold outreach)
- ✅ **Multiple geographies** (Jamaica + British Columbia = 2 pipeline channels)
- ✅ **Professional services upsell** (KPMG earns 3-5x license cost in implementation fees)
- ✅ **Credibility boost** (Big 4 validation signals enterprise-readiness)

**Opportunity Details:**

**KPMG Jamaica**
- **Market**: Financial services (banks, insurance, fintech)
- **Regulatory driver**: CMMC 2.0 (U.S. contractors in Caribbean)
- **Fit**: Authorization by Creto = compliance foundation for DoD contractors

### Priority 4: Symmetry Design Partner Proposal
**Strategic Score: 7.5/10 (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Why Priority 4:**
- ✅ **Product feedback loop** (design partner shapes roadmap)
- ✅ **Early revenue** (even if discounted)
- ⚠️ **Longer sales cycle** (design partnerships take time to negotiate)
- ⚠️ **Less urgent** than regulatory-driven opportunities (NextEra, KPMG)

- Referral value: Symmetry recommends Creto to customers

**Timeline to Close:**
- Agreement: 1-2 months (legal review, terms negotiation)
- First deliverable: 3 months (pilot integration)

**Execution Steps:**
1. Draft design partner proposal (terms, deliverables, timeline)
2. Schedule intro call with Symmetry VP of Product
3. Negotiate discount vs. commitment (50% off for 12 months?)
4. Formalize in design partner agreement (legal review)

Subject: Introduction - Authorization for AI Agents

Hi [Avatar Connex CTO],

[Mutual investor] suggested I reach out about authorization challenges for AI agents.

**The Problem:**
Traditional RBAC doesn't scale when you have thousands of AI agents accessing customer data. And there's no way to detect when an agent behaves suspiciously.

**Our Solution (Authorization by Creto):**
- Built for agentic enterprise (scales from humans to millions of AI agents)
- Guardian AI: Real-time threat detection for unusual agent behavior
- Quantum-resistant roadmap (future-proof your AI platform)

**Perfect Fit for Avatar Connex:**
- Your AI agents need authorization (who can access what)
- You need anomaly detection (is this agent acting normally?)
- You want AI safety features (catch rogue agents early)

**Pilot Offer:**
$5K/month for 3 months to test with your production AI agents. Includes Guardian AI threat detection.

Would love to show you a quick demo (15 min). What does your calendar look like this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
```
